# Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forest 🚖🌳

Welcome to the "Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests" project! This project aims to build a predictive model using the Random Forests algorithm to estimate taxi fares based on various factors. 

## Project Overview 📝

In this project, we will use a dataset containing information about taxi rides and their respective fares. Our goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the fare of a taxi ride given certain parameters such as distance, time of day, location, etc.

## Features 🎛️

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze the taxi fare data to gain insights.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data for optimal results.
- **Model Building:** Build a Random Forest model to predict taxi fares.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to get started.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries and dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the Notebooks:** Run the Jupyter notebooks in order to understand the data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.
